<h1 align="center">Hello Fellow < Developers / ></h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm Siva, a Web Developer learning and building from India 🇮🇳</h3>

<br/>

I enjoy building web applications and understanding how things work behind the scenes.
Most of my time goes into improving my frontend skills with React and strengthening my backend knowledge with Spring Boot and Node.js.

I like the open-source culture and the idea of learning in public by sharing my progress and projects here on GitHub.

Feel free to explore my repositories — I’m always learning and open to collaboration.
